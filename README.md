EnkiUtils
=========

EnkiUtilities is a fairly vague collection of methods, classes, and class categories that I've developed over the years that I find personally useful when writing iOS apps. Feel free to use any or all of these in your apps.

The categories, in particular, contain code that I've mostly not written, but rather found on line, mostly likely on stackoverflow and I've linked to the the authors when I can. I specifically do not claim copyright no them, they are not my work, just work that has been released into the wild for public consumption. (To be strictly legal, I should contact these authors for permission since they have not specified what licenese they've used, but that really seems like over kill for something that is short and published by the others for the purpose of reuse!

Installation
=========

You can copy the source code into your Xcode project, or make a git sub-project. This is an ARC project so if you aren't using ARC you're going to need to add your release and auto-release calls.

Be sure to look in the sampleCode folder for Xcode projects that use these utilities.
